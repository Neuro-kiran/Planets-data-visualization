# Planets Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of the "planets" dataset. The "planets" dataset is a collection of astronomical data, including information about planets outside our solar system (exoplanets). The dataset provides details on various attributes, such as orbital period, mass, year of discovery, and more.

The purpose of this analysis is to explore the dataset, visualize key insights, and gain a deeper understanding of exoplanets and their characteristics.

## Dataset Description

- **Name:** Planets Dataset
- **Source:** Seaborn (Built-in Dataset)
- **Number of Rows:** 1035
- **Number of Columns:** 6

## Analysis and Visualization

In this repository, you will find Jupyter Notebook files that demonstrate various data analysis and visualization techniques applied to the "planets" dataset. These techniques include:

1. **Histograms:** Explore the distribution of key variables, such as orbital period and planet mass.
2. **Scatter Plots:** Investigate relationships between variables, like orbital period and planet mass.
3. **KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) Plot:** Visualize the probability density of variables, providing a smooth representation of the data.
4. **Pair Plot:** Create pairwise scatter plots and histograms for multiple variables, allowing for a comprehensive view of relationships within the dataset.

These visualizations and analyses will help uncover patterns, trends, and characteristics of exoplanets.



## Getting Started

To run the Jupyter Notebook files, you'll need a Python environment with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn installed. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
